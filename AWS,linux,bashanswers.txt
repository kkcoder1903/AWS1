If statements: If statements allow you to execute a block of code if a condition is met.
Loops: Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times.
• What is command substitution in Bash, and how is it performed?
Answer: Command substitution allows you to execute a command and capture its output. The captured output can then be used as input to another command or as the value of a variable.
To perform command substitution, you simply enclose the command in parentheses. For example, to capture the output of the ls command, you would use the following code:
my_variable=$(ls)
The output of the ls command would then be assigned to the my_variable variable. You could then use the variable in your script by simply referencing its name.
• How can you pass command-line arguments to a Bash script?
Answer: To pass command-line arguments to a Bash script, you simply specify them after the script name when you run the script. For example, to pass the command-line argument hello to a Bash script called my_script.sh, you would run the following command:

./my_script.sh hello
