To create a highly available web application deployment using AWS services like EC2, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing, follow these steps:
Set up EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
To set up EC2 instances in multiple AZs:
1. Create a VPC and 3 public and 3 private subnets in each AZ.
2. Launch EC2 instances in each AZ, placing them in the public subnets.
3. Configure the security groups for your EC2 instances to allow traffic from the ELB and database.
4. Configure Auto Scaling to handle traffic fluctuations.

Auto Scaling is a service that automatically scales your EC2 instances up or down based on demand. This can help you to improve performance and reduce costs.
To configure Auto Scaling:
1. Create an Auto Scaling group and add your EC2 instances to it.
2. Configure the Auto Scaling group's desired capacity, minimum and maximum capacity, and scaling policies.
3. Configure the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances in multiple AZs.
4. Use an ELB to distribute traffic across instances.

An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. This helps to improve performance and scalability.
To use an ELB:
1. Create an ELB and attach it to your Auto Scaling group.
2. Configure the ELB's health check to monitor the health of your EC2 instances.
3. Configure the ELB's routing rules to distribute traffic across your EC2 instances.
4. Implement a database using RDS for data storage.

RDS is a managed database service that offers a variety of database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a database.
To implement a database using RDS:
1. Create an RDS database instance.
2. Configure the security group for your RDS database instance to allow traffic from your web application servers.
3. Configure your web application to connect to the RDS database instance.
4. Configure backups and monitoring for all components.

It is important to back up your web application and database regularly. You should also monitor all components of your web application for performance and health.
To configure backups and monitoring:
1. Configure RDS to automatically back up your database.
2. Configure CloudWatch to monitor your web application and database.
3. Configure alerts to be notified of any problems with your web application or database.
